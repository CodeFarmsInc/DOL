Example of how to save and retrieve data from disk.
---------------------------------------------------
All examples are set for MS Windows and VC++ compiler. For other platforms
and compilers, please, modify file names and the tt*.bat scripts.

BASIC SIMPLE METHOD (binary mode):
    Files: testa1.cpp, testa2.cpp, testa3.cpp, testa.h
    Compile and run the first program which creates data and saves it to disk: 
        tta1.bat
    Compile and run the second program which reads the data from the disk and
    prints it:
        tta2.bat

USING PORTABLE DATA (ASCII method):
    Files: testb1.cpp, testb2.cpp, testb3.cpp, testb.h
    Compile and run the first program which creates data and saves it to disk: 
        ttb1.bat
    Compile and run the second program which reads the data from the disk and
    prints it:
        ttb2.bat

FAST METHOD COMBINING PERSISTENCE WITH ALLOCATION (memory blasting):
    Files: testc1.cpp, testc2.cpp, testc3.cpp, testc.h
    Compile and run the first program which creates data and saves it to disk: 
        ttc1.bat
    Compile and run the second program which reads the data from the disk and
    prints it:
        ttc2.bat
