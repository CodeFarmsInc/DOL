<h1><font size="5" face="Arial">17. MERGING AND REDUCING
LIBRARIES</font></h1>

<p>If you start to develop your own library of macros and
functions, you have to resolve several problems: </p>

<ol type="a" start="1">
    <li>If you update the <em>zzmaster </em>file and you receive
        a new version of OrgC later, the <em>zzmaster </em>will
        collide with the one you have already developed.</li>
    <li>If both you and your colleague developed new macros, how
        do you merge the two libraries?</li>
    <li>If you only need several organizations, it does not make
        much sense to drag along hundreds of macros. You may want
        to reduce the library to only those macros which you will
        actually use.</li>
</ol>

<p>The best strategy for developing your own library is not to
modify the <em>zzmaster </em>file, but to create your own file
under a different name, say, <em>myMaster. </em>The <em>myMaster </em>file
has the same format as the<em> zzmaster </em>file but contains
only the organizations you developed yourself. All the files that
contain your new macros and parametric functions will be stored
together with OrgC files in the <em>orgC/macro </em>directory.</p>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial">Merging Libraries:</font></h3>

<p>When you are ready to merge the original OrgC library with
your new library, rename the original <em>zzmaster </em>to
something else, say<em> qqmaster. </em>Then run the program that
merges the two libraries and create a combined file called <em>zzmaster</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><em>cd orgC/macroÄ</em><br>
    <em>zzmerge qqmaster myMaster zzmaster</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can be repeated several times, gradually merging more
libraries:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><em>zzmerge master1 master2 aMaster<br>
    zzmerge aMaster master3 bMaster<br>
    zzmerge bMaster master4 zzmaster</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial">Reducing Libraries:</font></h3>

<p>If you want to select only a limited set of organizations and
functions, make a copy of <em>zzmaster</em>, edit it, and delete
the organizations and functions you don't want. Don't worry about
indices and pointers, and change only two sections: <em>ZZorganization</em>{
and<em> ZZfunction {</em>.</p>

<p>Be careful that you don't delete too many organizations. You
need the organization for every function you keep.</p>

<p>Then run <em>zzselect</em>, which creates a new, reduced <em>zzmaster,
</em>properly rearranged with all indices and pointers. The total
run may look like this:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><em>cd orgC/macro<br>
    cp zzmaster qqmaster<br>
    cp zzmaster rrmaster<br>
    vi rrmaster ... delete some organizations and functions<br>
    zzselect qqmaster rrmaster zzmaster</em></p>
</blockquote>
