Instruction how to compile the library with Microsoft Visual C++
------------------------------------------------------------------
(this description assumes that you installed the library in c:\orgc)

In order to use Visual C++ properly, check that your autoexec.bat has
the following PATH, INCLUDE, and LIB:
    PATH .......;C:\msdev\bin
    SET INCLUDE=c:\msdev\include
    SET LIB=c:\orgc\lib;c:\msdev\lib

The compilation is the same, whether you run under Win98 or WinNT.
The only difference is that, for Win9*, you have to remove line
    #define NT
from the file c:\orgc\lib\envmsft.h.

Compiling the library:
    cd c:\orgc
    msft
