Description:
 Declaration of the M_TO_1 relation between two object types. Source and
target entities can have the same type.
.pp
This organization uses 6 pointers: 1 on each entity, and 4 on the relation.
.pp
 ZZ_ADD_RELATION() adds a new relation between two entities;
 ZZ_DELETE_RELATION() deletes a given relation;
 ZZ_SOURCE() and ZZ_TARGET() move you from the relation to the source or
the target entity;
 ZZ_FORWARD() moves you from the source entity to the relation;
 ZZ_BACKWARD() moves you from target source entity to the relation.
 ZZ_A_RETRACE() traverses the relations for a given target entity.
 ZZ_A_FORWARD() can be used for a given source node; its loop executes just
once, and is equivalent to ZZ_FORWARD().

Example of the use:
   typedef struct River River;
   typedef struct Ocean Ocean;
   typedef struct FlowsInto FlowsInto;
   struct River {
       ZZ_EXT_River
       int length;
       char *name;
   };
   struct Ocean {
       ZZ_EXT_Ocean
       char *name;
   };
   struct FlowsInto {
       ZZ_EXT_FlowsInto
       char *mouth;
   };
   ZZ_ORG_M_TO_1(intoOcean,River,FlowsInto,Ocean)
