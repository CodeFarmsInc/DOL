Description:
 Delete the given element from the ring, reset the ring, and provide
a new entry into the ring.
If, on the entry, entry!=pp,
.i "entry"
will not change. Otherwise,
.i "entry" will point to the next element after
.i "pp,"
possibly NULL, if
.i "pp" was the last element of the ring.
  When calling this macro with (pp)=NULL or (pp) which has been already
deleted from the given organization (or has never been added to it),
the macro does nothing.
.sp 1
Note that since this organization is the single linked ring,
deleting an element is not fast. The algorithm has to go sometimes
through the whole ring to find how to reconnect the chain. If you call
this macro often, you should use the 'double-linked-ring' organization.
.(l
Example:

typedef struct Hotel Hotel;
struct Hotel{
    ZZ_EXT_Hotel
    char name;
    char numFloor;
    short numRooms;
};
ZZ_ORG_SINGLE_RING(hotels,Hotel)

Hotel *list,*h;

/* delete hotel hp from the list of all hotels, 'list' */
ZZ_DELETE_SINGLE_RING(hotels,list,hp)
.)l
On the order of the objects:
 If the original ring is A,E,D,C,B (starting at A), and A is deleted,
the new ring is B,E,D,C (starting at B). If any other object is deleted,
the start remains at A.
.sp
You can delete objects using the TRAVERSE loop. The following 3 lines will
disconnect the whole chain called 'hotels', and will return list=NULL at the
end.
