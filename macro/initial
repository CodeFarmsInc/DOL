Description:
 Depending on the
.i "mode"
parameter, it zeros the whole structure or all its ZZ_EXT_ pointers.
It can be used for a single structure or for an array of structures.
Time stamp is set to the current date and time.
SelfID is automatically set.
.pp
For initialization in C++ constructors, look at macro ZZ_INIT().
.pp
ZZ_PLAIN_ALLOC() and ZZ_OBJECT_ALLOC() are eqivalents of the
.i "creator"
function used in object oriented languages like C++ or Eifel. 
.i "Organized C"
is more flexible in that it also allows to use your own allocation
schemes, but in such case you must initialize new objects by
calling ZZ_INITIAL(). Automatically allocated objects must also be
initialized, see the example below.
.sp
WARNING:
 ZZ_INITIAL() must be called just before bringing a new object into use,
never on objects that are a part of some organization already. For automatic
variables, make it a rule to call ZZ_INITIAL() at the beginning of each
function only.
.(l
Example:

typedef struct Car Car;
struct Car {
    ZZ_EXT_Car
    char *make;
    int numWheels;
    float gasRate;
};

int myFunction(a,b)
Car *a;
int b;
{
    int m,n,q;
    char *p,s;
    Car oneCar,carList[50];

    ZZ_INITIAL(Car,0,1,&oneCar)
    ZZ_INITIAL(Car,0,50,carList)

    /* here starts the body of your function */
    ......
}
.)l
.(l
BAD EXAMPLE:

int myFunction(a,b)
Car *a;
int b;
{
    int m,n,q;
    char *p,s;
    Car oneCar,carList[50];

    /* here starts the body of your function */
    ......

    /* somewhere in the middle you have */
    ZZ_INITIAL(Car,0,1,&oneCar)
    ZZ_INITIAL(Car,0,50,carList)
    ......
}
.)l
Note that this macro can be used BOTH for the structures that have
ZZ_EXT... as for those that don't have it.
If the structure does not have ZZ-EXT, mode=0 will reset no pointers.
