Description:
 Declaration of a pager.
.pp
Pager is a user controlled  paging mechanism, which can be used
as one of the data organizations in an application program.
Essentially, the pager works like a very large array, which can
be indexed with a long index. The array automatically pages in and out
of memory depending on the indices most recently called. When closing
the pager, all its content remains on file, and can be opened later.
.pp
Similarly to a dynamic array or a hash table, a pager must live
on an object, such as the Head in the example below. 
.pp
Several pagers can operate simultaneously. One header can encapsulate
several pagers. The virtual array kept by the pager is continuous
across page boundaries. Objects larger than one page still can be handled by the pager.
The pager can operate with only 1 page in memory (as a buffered IO).
.sp
Only four functions are required to control the pager:
 ZZ_FORM_PAGER(id,hp,fileName,pgSize,numPgs,init);
     forms a new pager, or invokes an old one from a file.
 ZZ_IO_PAGER(id,hp,ind,buff,n,mode);
     provides read/write functions from the paging area.
 ZZ_ADDRESS_PAGER(id,hp,ind,ptr);
     for a given index ind, makes sure its page is loaded, and
     returns corresponding memory address, ptr.
 ZZ_CLOSE_PAGER(id,hp);
     closes a pager, stores all pages on its file, clear memory.
.sp
where
 id is the organization identifier;
 hp is pointer to the object that encapsulates the pager;
 (char *fileName) is the name of the file used by the pager;
 (int pgSize) is the size of one page in bytes;
 (int numPgs) is the max number of pages kept in memory;
 (int init) specifies initialization (0=none,1='\0', 2=' ');
 (long ind) is storage index by byte, starts from 0;
 buff buffer/object to go in/out, any type;
 (int n) is the size of the buffer/object;
 (int mode) specifies read/write (0=read, 1=write).
 (char *ptr) is a memory address.

Example of the use:
   typedef struct Head Head;
   struct Head {
       ZZ_EXT_Head
   };
   ZZ_ORG_PAGER(page,Head); /* Head will encapsulate the pager */
   typedef struct myObj myObj;
   struct myObj {
      ...   /* with ZZ_EXT or not */
   };

    main(){
        long i;
        Head *hp;
        char buff[80],*ptr;
        myObj *mp;

        ZZ_PLAIN_ALLOC(Head,1,hp);
        ZZ_FORM_PAGER(page,hp,"myFile",512,6,2); /* 6 pages, 512 bytes each */
        ...
        /* write object mp starting form index i */
        ZZ_IO_PAGER(page,hp,i,mp,sizeof(myObj),1); 
        /* retrieve 15 characters starting from index 14033 into buff */
        ZZ_IO_PAGER(page,hp,14033L,buff,15,0); 
        ...
        ZZ_ADDRESS_PAGER(page,hp,0L,ptr);
        printf("first char on the file is=%c\n",*p);
        ...
        ZZ_CLOSE_PAGER(page,hp); /* closes the pager and its file */
