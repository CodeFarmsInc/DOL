Description:
 Definition of the organization usually known as COLLECT (a collection).
Can be use for either un-ordered or ordered collection. 
This organization provides grouping of one object type under another
object type in situations, where access from the child to the parent
is not required.
.sp
Compare this organization with a TRIANGLE where, for any child, one
can find the parent.
.sp
Before Organized C Ver.2.0, users had two options to represent this
type of data: Either to use a TRIANGLE and carry the overhead
of one unused pointer, or to use a combination of LINK and RING,
and to use two steps when executing any operation.
A COLLECT provides a convenient set of commands for this relatively
frequent organization.

.)l
The order of the objects is as if added in this order: A,B,C,D,E.
When using ZZ_A_TRAVERSE_SINGLE_TRIANGLE(), the objects will be returned
in the reverse order: E,D,C,B,A.
.sp
Note that this organization is quite efficient in using small memory,
and it is fast when adding new members. But it is slow when deleting
a child.

Example of the use:
   typedef struct myStr1 myStr1;
   typedef struct myStr2 myStr2;
   struct myStr1 { /* will be parent of myTriangle */
       ZZ_EXT_myStr1
       int a,b,c,d;
   };
   struct myStr2 { /* will be child of myTriangle */
       ZZ_EXT_myStr2
       char *x,*y,*z;
   };
   ZZ_ORG_SINGLE_COLLECT(myGroup,myStr1,myStr2)
