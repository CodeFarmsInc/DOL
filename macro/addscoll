Description:
 This macro adds a new child to the collection under the given parent
.i "par."
If the collection does not exist yet, the macro sets the new element
as the first and only child.
.sp
 Collection is like one level of hierarchy, one parent and number
of children linked into a ring. It is similar to a TRIANGLE, except
that the parent pointer is not intranally stored on each child.
 The reason for having this organization in addition to the more
general tree is a memory saving,
and also the fact that, in a tree, all elements are supposed to have the
same type; in the collection (just like in a triangle, the parent has a
different type from the children.
 The saving in pointers, which are invisible to users, is 1/2 of the memory
needed for a tree. Each parent has only one pointer, and each child has
only one pointer.
.sp
 Note that if you allocate an object with any of the ZZ-commands,
all internal pointers are automatically initialized as NULL,
which has the same effect as if, for example, the parent has no children.
If the parent has been allocated in some other way, its content can be
set to NULL by calling ZZ_INITIAL().

Example:
Organize a group of employees with salary under 15000

typedef struct Employee Employee;
typedef struct SalaryGroup SalaryGroup;
struct Employee {
    ZZ_EXT_Employee
    char *name;
    int salary;
    int startDate;
};
struct SalaryGroup{
    ZZ_EXT_SalaryGroup
    int low,high;   
};
ZZ_ORG_SINGLE_COLLECT(under,SalaryGroup,Employee);

Employee *list,*pp,arr[20];
SalaryGroup group[5];
int i;

ZZ_INITIAL(SalaryGroup,0,5,group);
ZZ_INITIAL(Employee,0,20,arr);
group[0].low=0;
group[0].high=15000;
  ....

for(i=0,pp=arr;i<20;i++,pp++){
    if(Employee[i].salary<15000){
	ZZ_ADD(under,&(group[0]),pp);
    }
}
